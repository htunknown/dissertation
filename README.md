This project explores the correlation between social media sentiment and cryptocurrency prices, leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for price forecasting. By analyzing extensive data from Reddit and other financial sources, I developed a predictive model that integrates sentiment analysis with time-series data. The study highlights the significant impact of online sentiment on cryptocurrency market trends and offers a robust framework for traders and analysts to enhance decision-making processes. This interdisciplinary research contributes valuable insights into financial forecasting and the growing role of social media in market dynamics.
