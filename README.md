# Dissertation: Social Media Data Analysis of  Cryptocurrency Markets 

This project investigates the correlation between social media sentiment and cryptocurrency prices, focusing on data from Reddit over a one-month period. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, I employed combined Large Language Models (LLMs) for sentiment analysis and integrated these insights into Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for price forecasting. The study demonstrates how online sentiment significantly influences cryptocurrency market trends and provides a robust framework for traders and analysts to enhance decision-making processes. This interdisciplinary research contributes valuable insights into financial forecasting and highlights the growing impact of social media on market dynamics.
